[[🍀 Garden Tour/🧰 Library Guide/Tutorials/How to specify which notes in this library are synced to github]]

Why not use the [[🍀 花园导览/🧰 本库指南/Obsidian/Plugins/Obsidian Git]] plugin?
Because when it executes the git synchronization command, it will make obsidian very laggy. And I only need to use git to back up to github regularly. For other git version rollback functions, I use [[Spaces/3-Resource/Software-Sorting/macos-software/VSCode]] to open this library to execute, which is more comprehensive and easier to use. So I adopted the operating system-level automatic execution of git commands solution, rather than the obsidian built-in git execution solution.

How to configure the operating system-level automatic git command?
Just find an automated running tool, and set it to trigger the following command regularly:

```zsh
cd /Users/cdd/Works/knowledge-garden
git pull
git add .
git commit -m "auto by keyboard"
git push
```

Common tools on mac include: [[Spaces/3-Resource/软件梳理/macos软件/Keyboard Maestro]], [[hazel]], etc. I use the former. The configuration screenshot is as follows:
