Used the [[obsidian - shimmering theme]]. Written by a guy who is pursuing a PhD, it is updated almost every day. He is a keyboard efficiency expert who uses [[Spaces/3-Resource/软件梳理/linux常用命令/vim]], and also wrote an [[alfred plugin - shimmering-obsidian]], which has many functions and is very easy to use.

The reason for using it is: the default configuration is the most minimalist, and almost no logos or extra interface elements can be seen. Then you can gradually add the configuration you need through the very rich custom options in [[Cards/Style Settings]] as your usage habits change. This process of gradually adding things can make you understand what you want better, and gradually adjust your inner logic and habits of using [[Comparison and selection of shortcut keys, icons, and command lines]].

Update: It is officially announced that the author of the minimal theme will be responsible for the development of the obsidian default theme. It is estimated that it will meet us soon, so we can look forward to it.
