## Why open source notes

- Novices may be able to get substantial reference from this "instance library" on how to build a [[Spaces/2-Area/‚àë PKM]] system based on [[two-way linked notes]] in terms of [[content, tools and methodology]]. Most of the articles or sample libraries on the Internet that "talk about methodology without content, and talk about tools without methodology" are too high-level, and it may be difficult for you to intuitively and truly feel the charm of two-way linked notes.
- Taking notes with [[two-way links]] is very much like programming, where you can constantly quote and reuse other modules. Software source code can be open sourced, so why can't my notes? Except for personal privacy, all my thoughts and ideas, whether temporary or eternal, dark or bright, can be made public. Maybe no one will read them, but this is my attitude and learning philosophy: [[Input drives output, and output forces input]]. A big shot in the programming world has already done it, and I look up to him: [Andy's working notes](https://notes.andymatuschak.org/About_these_notes).
