up:: [[🍀 Garden Tour/🍀 Garden Tour]]

>[!INFO] Tip
> Only matters related to Obsidian and how to use this library are recorded here.

## 🤔 PLANNED

- Make the open source repository in the form of a release, and write effective update information in the commit.
	- Retreat for 2 weeks to fill in all the pits that were dug before about how to use this library.
- [[How to migrate old notes to obsidian and other two-way linked notes]]
- Goal: To create an out-of-the-box library for college students and new professionals with independent thinking ability, and by the way, to find people with the same frequency and get opportunities to communicate with outstanding young people.
- Complete [[∑ Building a Second Brain Translation and Reading Notes]] as a practical exploration of [[how to take English reading notes in obsidian]]
- Publish the notes on AI + Obsidian first.
- Update: Synchronize the clipped articles and content to Obsidian, and use Cursor to let AI read my clippings to understand me better.

## 🏹 DOING #todo/this-week

- Due to too much privacy, the digital garden has not been updated for more than 2 years and has become a digital tomb. Pick it up again on [[Calendar/Daily notes/2025/2025-07-09]].
- Reorganize and push the historically published notes to [[Sources/GithubStarsSync/knowledge-garden]] through the [[publish_by_frontmatter.py]] script. At the same time, use [[Cards/quartz syncer]] to update [[📥 Inbox/garden.oldwiner.top]] more conveniently in real time.
- Through more than 1 month of practice, improve the workflow of [[ACCESS Note Organization Method]].
	- Complete the [[Hybrid Note-taking Method]] of [[Common Note Organization Methods]] and solidify the usage process of ACCESS.
- Consider recording a video to explain the design philosophy and usage of this library.
- Create and maintain the [[English version of knowledge garden]] at the same time.
